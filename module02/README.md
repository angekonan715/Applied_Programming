# Overview
 Here is a java program which help student know their grade letter based on their GPA. It also gives some apprciations based on their performance. ie: A student with a A grate will get the following message :"Student demonstrates an Outstanding Understanding". 

My purpose writting this program is to demonstrate how java can have access to an existing database.
It also helps user to know how each student does in school. It's writen for people who are used to student gpa. 

Below is a youtube video link of my program:
